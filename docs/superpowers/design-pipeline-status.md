# 🎨 Design Pipeline Status

Living tracker of every design-track ticket + its position in the pipeline (workshop → handoff → readiness audit → build). Updated **optimistically** as items move between stages — the tracker is the answer to "what's ready for eng to pick right now?" and stays fresh only if maintained in the same PR as the state change.

> **Pipeline workflow reference:** `docs/superpowers/design-pipeline.md`

## System layers (not tickets — everything below builds on these)

| Layer | Handoff | Landed |
|---|---|---|
| Brand system — Palette A "Table Candlelight," Cinzel + IBM Plex, logomark, tokens | `design/design_handoff_the99_brand/` | refreshed 2026-07-24 (PR #54) |
| Voice — Kitchen Table (locked, verbatim in the richness README) | `design/design_handoff_the99_richness/README.md` | locked 2026-07-20 |

The READINESS exemption is narrow: it covers only a handoff that ships no surfaces and names no states. The richness pass ships per-surface mocks, so it was audited like a feature and sits in ✅ Shipped below rather than here.

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 | Ready for implementation (handoff landed AND readiness verdict ✅ Green or 🟡 Yellow — Yellow's gaps are closed eng-side in the plan PR; plan PR / build not yet started) |
| 🟡 | Awaiting Design addendum — audit verdict was 🟠 Orange (small Design round-trip needed before flipping Green) |
| 📐 | Brief locked, awaiting Claude Design handoff production (mocks, components) |
| 🎨 | Design in flight (workshop / handoff iteration / audit) |
| 🚦 | Paused (mid-workshop; awaiting Hugh input or external dependency) |
| 🕰️ | Backlog — labelled `type: design`, design cycle not started (no workshop, no brief). Ranked; the top of this list is what Design picks up next |
| ✅ | Fully implemented + shipped |

**Every `type: design` ticket sits in exactly one state above.** A ticket that fits none of them is a gap in this legend, not a ticket to file under the closest match — add it here as an unplaced row and say why, so the mismatch is visible instead of absorbed.

## 🟢 Ready for implementation (design complete, verdict Green or Yellow)

| # / vertical | Handoff | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **#158** Design: deck builder Add panel overhaul | `design/design_handoff_the99_add_panel/` | 🟢 Green (R2) | Plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-04-add-panel-overhaul-plan.md` — six PRs, payload first. R1 came back Yellow on three items; two closed audit-side (the EDHREC lift figure is a parse line off a payload we already cache, and the decks design table was in the repo, just not Design's tree) and R2 drew the one genuine gap — the empty *deck* state, whose `Open suggestions` CTA pointed at the retired sheet. R2 also found a shipped string the audit missed: the empty-builder caption says suggestions are "primed on the right", true only of the 340px column this pass deletes. One open product call — the owned-only default flips `false` → `true`; every state is drawn with both positions, so it is a one-line revert either way |
| **#42** Design: Import existing decks (Moxfield) | `design/design_handoff_the99_deck_import/` | 🟢 Green (R2, post-audit) | Plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-04-deck-import-plan.md`. Nineteen states at both breakpoints, rebased onto #158's add panel. The R2 audit ratified all three #158-opened calls (row-scoped combobox in an inline expander rather than the global bar; owned-only overridden off because matching runs against Scryfall, not the collection; unresolved rows outside both counts with the banner carrying the caveat) and closed every blocker without a redraw. Two audit corrections landed in R2: Design's "the parser can't tell failures 9 and 10 apart" was inverted — `parsePasteList` (`src/lib/manabox/paste.ts:38-40`) falls through to `quantity = 1` for any non-blank line, so gibberish yields rows that fail at *match*, not zero rows, and state 9's copy was rewritten from a parse failure to a match failure (`unparseable` → `noneMatched`). The completion-reveal collision was ruled 2026-08-04: suppress `shouldCelebrate()` on import-arrival, let it fire on the player's first own add. **Partially gated on build order — the plan's PRs 1–6 (schema, import pipeline, Moxfield fetch, entry surface, commander picker, counts + unresolved group) can start now; PRs 7–9 wait on #158's PR 6, because `quick-add-bar.tsx` does not exist yet and the arrival chrome sits inside the shell #158 rewrites** |

## 🟡 Awaiting Design addendum (audit Orange, one light Design pass to flip Green)

Holds items whose readiness verdict was 🟠 Orange — per `design-pipeline.md`, Orange means a small Design round-trip; a 🟡 Yellow verdict proceeds straight to plan PR and lands in 🟢 above.

| # / handoff | Verdict PR | Blockers to close | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|

_Currently empty — #52's R1 Orange was closed by its R2 revision (✅ shipped below), and #105's by its R3 (shipped below)._

---

## 📐 Brief locked, awaiting Claude Design handoff production

| Rank | Ticket | Brief | Path to eng handoff | Why this rank |
|---|---|---|---|---|

_Currently empty — #42's R2 handoff landed and its audit came back Green, so it sits in 🟢 above._

---

## 🎨 In flight

| Ticket | Stage | Notes |
|---|---|---|

_Currently empty — all four v1 UI surfaces (#5–#8) shipped 2026-07-19._

---

## 🚦 Paused (mid-workshop)

_Currently empty._

## 🕰️ Backlog (design cycle not started)

One ranked queue. Ranks 1–5 are v1 polish follow-ups against already-shipped surfaces; ranks 6–10 are post-v1 features ordered by the roadmap tracker (#44). Rank 6 sorts ahead of the other post-v1 work because both of its eng dependencies have already shipped. The per-surface brand + richness refresh tickets and #35 shipped ahead of everything here.

This list previously ran as two — a "Backlog" and a "Ready for design" — but the legend gave them the same definition (`type: design`, not yet workshopped), so nothing could be sorted between them by rule. The split was really a priority band, which the Rank column now carries.

| Rank | Ticket | Adjacency / notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **#140** Design: Inline error state for refused deck mutations | Ratification, not net-new design — the UI is **already live on `main`** (PR #139), which is why it outranks the rest. Five refusal strings need Design's sign-off or a rewrite; they are listed on the ticket |
| 2 | **#148** Design: ratify the richness pass interpretive calls | Ratification, same class as #140 — the UI is **already live on `main`** (PRs #66, #144, #145, #146). Three calls on the 99/99 completion reveal (band not surface, dismissible-only, a derived mobile composition) plus two invented strings the mock did not supply: a mobile empty-builder caption, and the guided banner's directive, which the mock's richness line would otherwise have deleted |
| 3 | **#159** Design: narrowing the commander recommendations | Same walk. The list offers no way in beyond scroll order — no filter by colour, mechanic, popularity or obscurity. Adjacent to **#52** (windowing — design shipped, eng ticket still open), which changes how much of the list is on screen but not how the user aims at it; whoever picks these up should read them together |
| 4 | **#160** Design: deck completeness guidance (lands, curve, multi-copy adds) | Same walk. Two halves: the builder never says how many lands a deck wants or how the curve looks, and adding several copies of a basic takes one click per copy. The second half is the eng-side "bulk add" from the feedback batch, held here because the affordance is a design question — a stepper on the row, a quantity field in the modal, or a lands-specific control |
| 5 | **#62** Design: Issue Inspector handoff reconciliation | Two copies of the #36 handoff exist; the mocks are byte-identical, and the nested README documents a footer (`View only · fix in export & re-upload`) present in neither mock nor `src/`. Needs a call on canonical location + whether that footer ships |
| 6 | **#130** + **#131** + **#132** Design: recommendations you can interrogate and act on — pre-populate a deck from recommendations · make Role Coverage explanatory and inspectable · suggest and add unowned cards | Post-v1. **One design cycle, not three** — Hugh flagged them as groupable when he filed them, and they share a premise: a recommendation the user cannot interrogate or act on is decoration. #131 is the seam; it needs #132's unowned cards to have anything to recommend beyond the collection, and it is where #130's "why was this picked" reasoning would surface. Split apart, each brief answers a third of one question. Both eng dependencies have now shipped — #127 landed the card-detail modal wiring #131's inspection gap needs, and #129 fixed the "Owned only" toggle under #132 — so nothing blocks this but a workshop. Open for #132: whether #44 already scopes it |
| 7 | **#9** Design: Win/loss tracking for decks (incl. per-game strength/weakness notes — one combined brief) | Post-v1; extends the deck page from #8; unlocks the tuning tier |
| 8 | **#43** Design: Cross-check recommendations against committed cards | Post-v1; touches #7 recs + #8 builder; value scales with deck count, so it sorts behind #42 (now 📐 above) |
| 9 | **#10** Design: Deck tuning suggestions from play results | Post-v1; LLM tier; blocked on #9's data model — needs accumulated play data |
| 10 | **#151** Design: per-deck printing override for a card's art | Post-v1. **Split out of #42** at the 2026-08-02 workshop — #42 had inherited it from #105 on the reasoning that a deck-level override needs a deck to attach to, but it is unrelated to import (import is getting a deck in; this is how a deck looks once it is there) and #42's brief was already large. Last because it is polish: `card_art_preferences` is keyed `(user_id, oracle_id)` and `deck_cards` has no printing column, so it needs new storage and a new read path for no functional gain |

### Rank 6 — open questions carried into the workshop

Kept here rather than in the table cell, since one cycle covers three tickets:

- **#130** — "Build this deck" drops the user into an empty deck at the moment of highest intent. Full auto-fill vs. opt-in per role vs. a reviewable "suggested starting 30"; what happens when the user owns too few cards for a role; how an auto-added card reads differently from a chosen one.
- **#131** — three gaps as one piece of work: no reasoning behind a grouping's picks, no way to open a recommended card, and no path from "good fit" to acting on it.
- **#132** — the All / Shopping split promises a buying workflow that cannot happen, because every recommendation path is scoped to the collection. Needs recommendations that reach outside it, and a way to add an unowned card.

---

## ✅ Shipped

The first six shipped against the pre-richness baseline; **#51** then applied brand tokens + the richness pass across all four v1 surfaces, so shipped UI and the current handoff mocks no longer diverge. Three interpretive calls on the 99/99 completion reveal — band rather than full surface, dismissible-only rather than a ~4s timer, and a derived mobile composition — are recorded in `docs/superpowers/design-tables/decks.md` §Completion Reveal. Those, plus two strings invented where the mock supplied none, await Design ratification as **#148** (backlog rank 2).

| **#35** Branded user menu (eng **#13**) | `design/design_handoff_the99_user_menu/` | 2026-08-03 (PRs #156, #164) |
| **#52** Commanders · list windowing | `design/design_handoff_the99_commanders_windowing/` | 2026-08-03 (PR #165) — the *design* is fully shipped; eng ticket **#52** stays open for the server-side half (EDHREC fanout still runs for every candidate before first render) |
