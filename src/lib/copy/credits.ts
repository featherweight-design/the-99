// The shared model credits — copy.
//
// ONE line, drawn beside every control that spends a credit: Suggested changes today, and the
// deck synopsis (sub-project 6), which imports this module rather than writing its own. Both
// features spend the same units (Hugh, 2026-09-23), so a reader told two different things about
// one counter would be told at least one untrue thing.
//
// The window is a rolling 24 hours (Hugh, 2026-09-23), so the line names WHEN the next credit
// comes back in the reader's own clock, never "today" or a reset time: a rolling allowance has
// no reset. Design drew `14:20`; the reader reads 12-hour times, so `clockTime` formats it
// (READINESS-r3-audit.md, engineering note 2).
//
// PLACEHOLDER wording, owed to /copy-review: Design's rolling strings (`firstNoteRolling`,
// `exhaustedRolling`, canvas v2 :740-741) are transcribed; `again` merges Design's again note
// with the rolling form and is undrawn; a reader with every credit in hand is undrawn too, and
// the line then gives the count alone, since no credit is out to come back. The feature noun in
// `spent` is an open choice for Hugh: Design wrote "Synopses", and the Analysis tab now calls
// that section an overview.
